Limitations
-----------
Exception to adding games to database: 
If the game's name and studio are the same as another in the database, 
but the year is different, it is fine to add. However, if all 3 are
the same as another in the database, the game wll not be added. This
functionality is due to remakes, remasters, and reboots causing games 
to have the same name and studio, but different release year.

Also, the adding/searching/deleting are case insensitive.

Note: Battlefield 1 may sound like it is the first game in its franchise, but
it is not, rather it is a newer game than battlefield 3 and 4 in the database.txt
